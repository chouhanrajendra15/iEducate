          The Education World Forum, the largest[1][2] annual gathering of
          education and skills ministers in the world, is held in London each
          January. The event is supported by the Foreign Commonwealth and
          Development Office, the Department for Education, the Department for
          International Development, the Department for International Trade and
          the British Council.[3] The Education World Forum brings together
          Ministers of Education, Higher Education and Skills, their advisors
          and delegations from across the world to address key issues and to
          share the education system challenges they face, the solutions they
          have found, the learning that has occurred and the successes they have
          achieved.

          The Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) is a component of the Education
          Index. It expresses the number of students enrolled in a given level
          of education as a percentage of the number of people within the
          official age for that level of education. GER can exceed 100% because
          some enrolled students may fall outside the official age range.[1] The
          tables below show GER for each country in Asia. It is organized into
          five regions of population: South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia,
          West Asia and Central Asia. Data is shown for four levels of
          education: pre-primary, primary, secondary and tertiary. (Tertiary
          education is also referred to as higher education). The last year for
          which data are available is shown in parentheses following each number
          in the table. If the year is the same as for the column to the left,
          the year is omitted.

          Colonial New England encouraged its towns to support free public
          schools funded by taxation. In the early 19th century, Massachusetts
          took the lead in education reform and public education with programs
          designed by Horace Mann that were widely emulated across the North.
          Teachers were specially trained in normal schools and taught the three
          Rs (of reading, writing, and arithmetic) and also history and
          geography. Public education was at the elementary level in most
          places. After the Civil War (1861â€“1865), the cities began building
          high schools.For primary and secondary education, government schools
          educate approximately 60 per cent of Australian students, with
          approximately 40 per cent in non-government schools.[5] At the
          tertiary level, the majority of Australia's universities are public,
          and student fees are subsidised through a student loan program where
          payment becomes due when debtors reach a certain income level.

          Education in Australia encompasses the sectors of early childhood
          education[8] (preschool) and primary education (primary schools),
          followed by secondary education (high schools), and finally tertiary
          education, which includes higher education (universities and other
          higher education providers) and vocational education (registered
          training organisations).[9] Regulation and funding of education is
          primarily the responsibility of the States and territories;[2]
          however, the Australian Government also plays a funding role.[10] For
          primary and secondary education, government schools educate
          approximately 60 per cent of Australian students, with approximately
          40 per cent in non-government schools.[5] At the tertiary level, the
          majority of Australia's universities are public, and student fees are
          subsidised through a student loan program where payment becomes due
          when debtors reach a certain income level.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Education in Africa</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          The history of education in Africa can be roughly divided into pre-
          and post- colonial periods. Since the introduction of formal education
          to Africa by European colonists, African education, particularly in
          West and Central Africa, is characterised by both traditional African
          teachings and European-style schooling systems. The state of education
          reflects not only the effects of colonialism, but instability
          resulting from and exacerbated by armed conflicts in many regions of
          Africa as well as fallout from humanitarian crises such as famine,
          lack of drinking water, and outbreaks of diseases such as malaria and
          Ebola, among others.[1] Although the quality of education and the
          quantity of well-equipped schools and teachers has steadily increased
          since the onset of the colonial period, there are still evident
          numerous inequalities in the existing educational systems based on
          region, economic status, and gender.[2][3]

          Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or
          preceptor after initiation.[28] The education was delivered through
          Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and his Shishya (students
          /disciples) was very important part of the education.[29] Takshasila
          (in modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher
          learning institute in India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it
          is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in
          modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official
          membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have
          existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a
          Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.
          Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in
          the modern sense of university.
